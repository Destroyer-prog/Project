Shapes Class
Christian Ruiz

This project will build a Java program where it features a base class called Shape with a method called calculateArea() that calculates the area of every shape. 
To do that, four classes have to be created; Rectangle, square, triangle, and circle.
Each class will include different attributes such as base, length, height, radius, etc.
The calculateArea() method will return each shape's area.
